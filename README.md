# auto-promoter

Help place ads to web page automatically based on the current page layouts

## Usage

### Import from HTML, with CDN

```html
<script
  src="https://***/auto-promoter.js"
  data-ads-placement="auto"
  data-google-ads-slots="1,2,3,4,5"
></script>
```

## Why the fuss?

If your site uses Google Adsense and other Affiliate networks, you might have the following concerns:

- Google's auto-ads uglified the whole site but meanwhile don't wanna add ads manually
- Hope to have some more granular control over these auto-ads
- Need to place the Affiliate link or banner together with Google Adsense

Well, auto-promoter is an opinionated solution to position commercial contents from different vendors.

## How does it work?



## Browsers support

It's targeting on ES6 compatible browsers (very modern browsers). See details [here](https://caniuse.com/?search=esmodule).

Sorry, IE is out of scope.

## TODO

- [ ] ES5 usage
- [ ] ES6 module usage
- [ ] Dependencies installation improvement
- [ ] Usage document
